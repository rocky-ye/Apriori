Python Implementation of Apriori Algorithm 

List of files:

1. Apriori.py
2. T10I4D100Kc.txt
3. README(this file)


Usage:

This program should be executable with 3 parameters: the name of the input dataset file, the threshold of minimum support count, and the name of the output file (in that order). 

For example, to run the program with the test file, a support of 500, and the output name of outPutFile.txt:

    python3 Apriori.py T10I4D100K.txt 500 outPutFile.txt
 

Results for the following values of support:  

Support: 
400: 89 seconds
500: 29 seconds
600: 16 seconds
